we can write a document which aims to explain how to train a lora with stable diffusion 3.5 Large. We will need to explain in steps for newcomers and include details for the experienced level students.

the basic process is:

```md
1. gather images
2. add captions for each sample (optional)
3. archive the images in .zip format and upload to trainer
4. select auto caption (if not captioned)
5. choose the Trigger word
6. use Prodigy, 1.0 LR
7. increase batch to 4 (faster)
8. increase steps from 1000-2000
9. ensure to use "768,1024" with resolution
10. start training !

The Lora will be returned in the .tar archive, you can open and rename your Lora.safetensors to something memorable.
```

We can write up two Training documents with each being the same, however at different skill levels:
1. "I have trained AI models before"
2. "I don't know what .json is"

these two documents will be named "Lora-Training-Experienced.md" & "Lora-Training-Beginner.md"
